# CleverBoard

CleverBoard is an iOS App developed with Neural Network algorithm for recognizing images. You can teach to recognize 6 symbols. Draw three times every symbol. Then
the app will be learning some time. After that you can draw symbol which will be rcognized. It is very easy.
The app saves the learned model and you don't have to learn every time. 

I consider the CleverBoard as a code example. Here used RxSwift, MVVM.

## Requirements

- Xcode 10.0
- Swift 4.2
- RxSwift 4.3.1
